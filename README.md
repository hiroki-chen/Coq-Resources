# Coq Resources

This repository contains a bunch of interesting and useful tools, materials, and many other stuffs that help one with doing verification with Coq.

## You are a noob!

Resources for noobs who have never ever played with Coq.

* [Inria - Official Reference Manual](https://coq.inria.fr/doc/V8.18.0/refman/)
* [Inria - Standard Library](https://coq.inria.fr/doc/V8.18.0/stdlib/)

* [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/): This book is just fantastic: it teaches you how to write correct code and prove it in Coq. It gives rise to basic PL stuffs like verification techniques and types.
* [VSCoq](https://github.com/coq-community/vscoq): Extension for VS Code.

## Intermediate

Till now, you should be able to verify something non-trivial...
